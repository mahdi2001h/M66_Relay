---------------------------------------------------------------------------
bug-fixes and enchancements:

1. Modified the implement of RIL_GetLocation() and RIL_GetLocationByCell() from synchronization mode to asynchronization mode. Developers may refer to ril_location.c and example_location.c for usage.

2. Added new files: ril_sim.h and ril_sim.c, and renamed function name.
   RIL_NW_GetSIMCardState() --> RIL_SIM_GetSimState()
   
   Added RIL APIs£ºRIL_SIM_GetIMSI(), RIL_SIM_GetCCID().
   
3. Set the PIN PIN_PCM_OUT as the default GPIO for external watchdog in custom_sys_cfg.c (developers may change according to the real design.)

4. Added RIL API: 
   RIL_GetIMEI() in ril_system.h/.c.
   RIL_NW_SetAPN(),RIL_NW_GetIPStatus(),RIL_NW_OpenPDPContext(),RIL_NW_ClosePDPContext(),RIL_NW_GetOperator() in ril_network.h/.c.
   
5. Fixed the bug that Ql_GPRS_GetPDPContextId() cannot get the PDP context id after deactivating the PDP by Ql_GPRS_Deactivate().

6. Fixed the bug that -3£¨RIL_AT_BUSY £©is returned when calling Ql_RIL_SendATCmd() in multitasking.

7. Fixed the problem that the alarm for power-up cannot work. Developers may refer to ril_alarm.c and example_alarm.c for usage. (need the core firmware after change time)

8. Enchance audio play:
   Added support to play audio data as backgroud sound in the state of calling. 
   Added RIl APIs: API RIL_AUD_PlayMemBg(),RIL_AUD_StopPlayMemBg().
   
   Regarding how to play audio resource data, you can refer to the REAMD ME in SDK\tools\AudioFile_Converter directory.
   
9. Added API Ql_RIL_AT_GetErrCode() to get the specific error code when Ql_RIL_SendATCmd() failed.

10. Added files ril_dtmf.h, ril_dtmf.c, and the relavant APIs to support sending/detecting WDTMF.

11. Updated documents: ATC document, user guide document and RF layout AN document in SDK\docs directory.

12. Added DTMF RIL interface and example_dtmf.c.

13. Added Example_gps_iic.c.
